Lying back in the cool welcome shade

of an aromatic juniper tree,

We slow down in order to rest

before continuing on our hike.

In the quiet contemplative solitude,

it is the 'in-between' spaces that begin to hold our attention;

Turquoise sky peeking through gnarled branches dancing overhead,

Wide open expanses framed by grandiose arches,

Small fissures, one day creating monumental sandstone formations,

Sounds of silence amidst our reverential whispers,

Sacred intervals residing in our breath,

along with the liminal beats of our heart.

In stillness our senses become unfurled;

blessed to receive the ancient wisdom

of this vast and ineffable living library

surrounding us.
