Nature,

in her exquisite adornment,

peels  back the layers

of all that is tenuous in my heart,

laying me bare.

She gently caresses my face

with her mist,

laughing me a rainbow,

tossing my hair about.

Blowing me kisses,

she beckons me to stay outside,

and play with her . . .

just a little while longer. . .

To skip and dance

upon the sweetness

of her cool damp earth.

Dripping wet,

shaking with ecstasy,

finding my way home

by the light of the moon,

shyly peeking through silver veils.
